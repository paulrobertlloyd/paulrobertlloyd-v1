                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>As a trip intended to give just a brief introduction to Europe, covering <a href="/2009/05/a_european_adventure">nine cities in three weeks</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise that I found it difficult balancing sightseeing with relaxation. Many of the cities I visited had so much to offer, that it was sometimes overwhelming trying to fit it all in.</p>
                    <p>I often find travelling to a destination more enjoyable than the destination itself (and partly the reason why I&#8217;ve become so enamoured with rail travel in recent years) yet happily I didn&#8217;t find that to be the case during this trip. Rail travel remains unrivaled for me&#8212;the level of comfort, ease of use and overall experience beats flying hands down&#8212;but it&#8217;s testament to the cities I visited that the train journeys became a secondary experience.</p>
                    <p>Travel related highlights did however include riding the sleeper between Madrid and Paris, and the sleeper-that-wasn&#8217;t between Geneva and Barcelona. Due to maintenance on the line this service was replaced by a gruesome 9 hour coach ride, in which passengers were ushered around by a short Spaniard (with a passing resemblance to Robert De Niro) and included a 4am stop at a French motorway service station. Very bizarre.</p>
                    <p>Of the cities I visited, Lucerne and Innsbruck stand out as favourites, certainly in terms of their stunning landscapes and the fantastic accommodation (the <a href="http://www.weisseskreuz.at/">Weissz Kruez</a> in Innsbruck having once hosted a young Mozart for example). Both remain strong candidates for a return visit.</p>
                    <p>I&#8217;m also keen to return to Valencia in Spain, if not only because I wasn&#8217;t able to meet-up with my friend <a href="http://blog.aiama.com/">Gerir</a> this time round, but also because I spent most of my time on the beach and by the pool, when the city had so much to offer&#8212;especially in terms of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1268-pack-half-of-what-you-think-you-need">incredible architecture</a>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the trip I enjoyed toying with different languages, although I often felt embarrassed trying to use them. German was my favourite, and I would like to try and re-familiarise myself with it again.</p>
                    <p>This desire actually plays into a larger re-assessment of Europe (the people, their attitudes and our integration with it). I like to think I&#8217;ve become less euro-sceptic since living in the States, and this trip has only continued that trend, and I hope to write about this in more depth sometime soon.</p>
                    <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
                    <p>Possibly more for my benefit than yours, I&#8217;d like to finish up with a few lessons I learnt from this trip:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Over the years, I&#8217;ve come to realise that preparation is important in making trips a success, and whilst I didn&#8217;t manage to create itineraries for later parts of the trip, what preparation I did do meant I could hit each city running.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Be a tourist:</strong> I&#8217;ve often thought the best way to get a feel for a large city is by jumping on the metro (just get a day ticket, pick a destination and head towards it), rather than use the more touristy forms of transport, but this trip finally saw me embrace my inner tourist! The &#8216;Batobus&#8217; along the River Shine in Paris (€12 for a hop-on/hop-off day pass), and Barcelona&#8217;s open-top &#8216;Bus Turístic&#8217; (€21 for a one-day ticket valid on all three routes) both turned out to be quite useful for getting an overview of these cities and seeing the main sights.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Pack half, and then pack half again:</strong> This tip is one <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1268-pack-half-of-what-you-think-you-need">I read a few years ago</a> but still seem to have trouble perfecting. Each successive holiday I try to do this, and each time I realise I could have packed even less still. I spent most of this holiday carrying a laptop with a burnt out logic board, and a rarely used tripod, both of which I debated whether or not to take with me. The lesson here is if you&#8217;re not sure if need something, you definitely won&#8217;t. Keep to the bare essentials only.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Check roaming charges for data before you go:</strong> Guess who didn&#8217;t. Ouch.</p>
                        </li>
