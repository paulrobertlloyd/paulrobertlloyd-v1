Whilst I was back in the UK, a friend told me I should blog more about what I'm getting up to here in the States. I think that sounds like a great idea, and comes at a time when I plan on making the most of my summer here in California.

Since my return on Tuesday, I've seen [the Kaiser Chiefs in concert][1] on Friday night, and yesterday took a tour around some San Franciscan neighbourhoods I've yet to discover with my flatmate Tom. Photos from both these events have been uploaded to my [Flickr stream][2] so please check out the following sets:

* [A Day Exploring San Francisco](http://flickr.com/photos/paulrobertlloyd/sets/72157622798017859/)
* [Kaiser Chiefs](http://flickr.com/photos/paulrobertlloyd/sets/72157622639222453/)

The activities continue. Tonight Gerir, Tom and I head down to San Jose to see comedian Gabriel Iglesias at the Improv (you can check out [some videos of him over at YouTube][3]), Tuesday looks set to see a night out with some former and current Ning colleagues, and then on Wednesday night I'm going to see Travis at The Fillmore--a concert I'm really looking forward to.

I'll be sure to keep you posted.
