This site is built using a variety of third-party tools and services.

It was produced using an Apple [MacBook Pro][mbp], with [Fireworks][fw] used to realise early design concepts and ideas, before then being marked up as HTML in [Dreamweaver][dw].  I use and recommend [(mt) Media Temple][mt] for web hosting.

I always try to adhere to [Web Standards][wasp] and best practices. As such, HTML markup should validate as [HTML 5][html], visual design is provided using valid [CSS][css], and the syndicated feed is valid RSS.  Behaviour and effects are programmed using the [JQuery][jq] JavaScript framework, and an extra layer of semanticism is available thanks to [Microformats][mf].
