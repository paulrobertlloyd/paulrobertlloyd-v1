                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>As I indicated in <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2006/11/moblogging_in_new_york">my previous post</a>, my trip to New York earlier this week was a good opportunity to try out the &#8216;Blog This&#8217; feature of my new Sony Ericsson K800i, and I guess the whole concept of keeping a moblog as well. Here are some of my thoughts from this experiment.</p>
                    <p>As you you can see if you <a href="http://lloydyweb.blogspot.com/">visit the site I was posting to</a>, there are only a few images that I managed to post during my three day trip, one of which is posted a day after the picture was taken. This should give you a clue as to how good the &#8216;Blog This&#8217; feature actually is on the K800i.</p>
                    <p>These are just some of the problems I encountered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>After posting an entry to your blog, I would get a success message, and then the opportunity to view the blog. At first, the link to my blog had been mangled into an unrecognisable character, meaning I had to manually change the bookmark to my blog. Whether this was a result of me changing the URL I wanted to publish to within Blogger, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>More problematic, was that on viewing the blog, I would often find that the entry had <strong>not</strong> in fact been published. I got the impression that you needed 100% connectivity during the upload, for it to actually have worked.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In these such cases, the entry I had just written was not saved anywhere on the phone, and I was often having to write an entry two or three times before it would appear on the site. I expected upon hitting an error (when it recognised an error had occurred of course) that you would be returned to the editing screen, but this was not the case.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Another incredibly limiting feature was that you could not publish portrait photos. Whenever I tried, the image would automatically rotated on to it&#8217;s side, meaning I couldn&#8217;t upload a lot of the photos I wanted to.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Finally, the HTML (or XML) that the phone spits out is very poor and unstructured&#8212;being a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element. There is also nowhere that you can actually edit this template (at least to my knowledge).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Another problem, relevant to this topic, and equally as annoying, is that if I rotated or altered an image in any way on the phone, it&#8217;s &#8216;received&#8217; date was updated to the time I performed that action (i.e. the modified date became the created date). I have yet to see if this effects the EXIF data on these images, but again, this was totally unexpected, and damned annoying&#8212;especially given the new &#8216;Browse by date&#8217; view that you can choose when browsing photos. Right now, and because of this issue, it&#8217;s a totally meaningless option.</p>
                    <h2>Looking for Alternatives</h2>
                    <p>In short, this experiment has ended in failure. I actually enjoyed the idea of keeping a moblog, and when it worked, it worked well, but those times were few and far between. The whole experience was hampered by ill-conceived software that has been badly implemented. Until this improves, I will need to find an alternative method of quickly posting photos direct from my mobile, which I am still interested in doing. </p>
                    <p>Thanks to Ian for pointing out the Flickr service on the new Nokias (which I believe also have Six Apart&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog">Life Blog</a> service included too), but I won&#8217;t be getting a new phone for some time, and I do like the Sony Ericssons. So right now I&#8217;m looking for a Java app that I can install on my phone, and will let me upload photos to my Flickr account (this being a quicker method than by e-mail, which also isn&#8217;t working on this new phone). Perhaps, I can then use their API to stream them into this site, who knows.</p>
                    <p>Either way, the K700i, is not a great phone for moblogging, and the feature stinks of gimmick rather than a useful tool. It&#8217;s a great user-generator for Blogger, but this experiment has only gone to remind me how much that sucks too.</p>
