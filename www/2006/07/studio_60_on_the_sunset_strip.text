Dubbed by many as the West Wing meets Hollywood, it actually contains my favourite actor from that show--[Bradley Whitford][1] (who played Josh Lyman) as well as a few other familiar faces from the Bartlet Whitehouse--[Matthew Perry][2] (Joe Quincy), [Timothy Busfield][3] (Danny Concannon), and surely it's a matter of time before [Joshua Malina][4] appears on the new show (having appeared in every Aaron Sorkin project to date). It also stars [Nate Corddry][5], who will be familiar to [Daily Show][6] viewers.

I'm really looking forward to this one, and should hopefully fill the gap left by the axed West Wing.  Studio 60 airs 'in the fall' in the States on NBC, but I would imagine it would arrive in the UK the beginning of next year, and no doubt on Channel 4.
