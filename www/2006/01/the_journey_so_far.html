                    <p>As of this week I am no longer an employee of Orange Vision Ltd, but working for Ning, Inc. where I am now Senior Designer. It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to realise what a fantastic opportunity this is, and one I don&#8217;t think I have fully come to terms with.</p>
                    <p>This is just the latest and greatest episode of an online journey that I have been on since 1999. Given my amazing new position, I thought I would try and summarise the road travelled so far. A big part of this journey has involved developing a passion and interest in <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a>, but more recently <a href="/2005/10/the_we_in_web">I have been thinking</a> more about how we can use the web in more positive ways rather than as just another marketing tool.</p>
                    <h2>First Steps</h2>
                    <p>My first ever experience of the web came in 1999, during my time at <abbr title="Walsall College of Arts and Technology">WALCAT</abbr>. After the long mind-numbing days at college, I would spend a couple of hours in the library, where I would log on and surf this interweb thingy everyone was raving about. Before long, I had signed up for free web space with Tripod and begun building my first site in Microsoft Word.</p>
                    <p>I found the web to be a free and easy way for me to get creative, and the instant satisfaction of online publishing and design caught my imagination and has never let go!</p>
                    <p>Over the following years, my Tripod webspace was replaced with a proper hosting account and later a domain name. I experimented with web editors such as Frontpage and Dreamweaver and in the process learnt about &#8216;great&#8217; HTML features like framesets, tables and used hacks such as spacer images that allowed me to create the layouts I wanted.</p>
                    <h2>Growth</h2>
                    <p>My growth as a professional web developer however, only begun once I started to learn and implement web standards. What started out initially as finding out how the links on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News Online</a> changed colour on mouse over, turned into a new path of learning.</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 2001, I decided to read up and learn about CSS (which was how the fancy links on BBC News were created), and stumbled across web-standards via the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/">NYPL Style Guide</a>. Now I&#8217;m a stickler for doing things properly, so reading about clean, meaningful and structured code, and the separation of presentation from content, seemed not only to make sense, but simply best practice.</p>
                    <p>From that point on, I spent endless nights reading sites such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://www.glish.com/">glish</a>, <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">MeyerWeb</a> etc, and before long I started redeveloping this site (<a href="http://www.fourtwo.net/">and</a> <a href="http://www.thegetaways.co.uk/">others</a>) using these new methods.</p>
                    <h2>Employment</h2>
                    <p>In July 2004, with this new bag of tricks, a newly gained Graphic Design degree, and the eventual realisation that McDonald&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t really a great career choice, <a href="/2004/07/all_change">I gained employment with Orange Vision</a>. Orange Vision was a company that had a growing reputation, especially in the property industry, but built sites that swam in the deepest of tag soup, and as a result were slow, inaccessible and hard to manage.</p>
                    <p>However the first opportunity I got to design a site from scratch, I found myself up against an argument I hadn&#8217;t foreseen. Having spent a Thursday and Friday building <a href="http://www.torbayhomes.net/">a property site</a> laid out entirely using CSS and XHTML, I returned to work Monday to find that the site had been re-coded using tables for layout. Why would someone do such I thing? Speaking to the companies Managing Director, it became clear that there was a massive knowledge gap between what was being taught in the emerging web standards community and what was being practised on the front line.</p>
                    <p>A continued resistance to using web standards, spurred me on to learn more so that I could argue my case in the daily discussions and heated debates that were very much a part of my early employment at Orange Vision. Finally, in February 2005, I was given the opportunity to propose a move towards using web standards, and I produced the following document:</p>
                    <p><a href="http://s3.paulrobertlloyd.com/downloads/web_standards_with_vision.pdf">Web Standards with Vision</a> (PDF, 126Kb)</p>
                    <p>This proposal was agreed upon, and as a result the studio team also <a href="/2005/06/reflecting_on_atmedia_2005">attended the @media 2005 conference</a> in London. Here I got to listen, meet and talk to many of my peers, and was probably the highlight of last year.</p>
                    <h2>The Future</h2>
                    <p>However, during 2005, events like <a href="http://www.live8live.com/">Live8</a> and <a href="http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/">MakePovertyHistory</a> also made me think about my place on this earth and the responsibilities it brings with it. Working 9 til 5 designing web sites for estate agents seemed the most useless thing I could be contributing to this world. I wanted to do something much more positive with all I had learnt over the past 6 years.</p>
                    <p>Fate came a knocking, and in November I was given the chance to do some freelance work with <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>&#8212;a web 2.0 start-up that &#8216;enables anyone to match, transact, and communicate with other people&#8217;. It may not be a solution for world poverty, but it certainly ain&#8217;t about selling houses, and the opportunities it presents both for me personally and for the web as a whole are compelling.</p>
                    <p>That brings me to today, where I am now a full-time contractor for Ning, and where a lot of exciting stuff is set to happen for all involved. I get the feeling my next steps on this journey will no longer be as focused as much on web-standards and other technologies that underlay the web, but something far more exciting. And I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
