Being a massive fan of 'The Adam & Joe Show', it was a happy day when I discovered Adam Buxton's blog. Better still, over the last few weeks he has been uploading some short interviews he made with Ken Korda for 'The Last Word' on More4.

Kenneth Korda is a big figure in Hollywood, and given his involvement in some recent films (sometimes working closely with the directors), meant he was just the man Channel 4 were looking for to get an insight into their production:

  * Chief Winky Wrangler on the set of [Battle In Heaven](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordabattleinheaven.mp4)
  * Jim Jarmusch's Sandwich Supervisor during the filming of [Broken Flowers](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordabrokenflowers.mp4)
  * Magic Minimiser on [Chronicles of Narnia](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/narnia.mp4)
  * Quirk Regulator on [Elizabethtown](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordaelizabethtown.mp4)
  * Being hired by Dave Stewart to write songs for [Flightplan](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/flightplan.mp4) (when it was going to be a rock opera)
  * Talking about his original screen adaptation for the latest Harry Potter film: [Harry P and the Firery G](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/harrypotter.mp4)
  * His role as Lady Expert on [In Her Shoes](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordainhershoes.mp4)
  * Third Associate Assistant to the Script Co-ordinators Assistant on [Lord of War](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordalordofwar.mp4)
  * Producing the original trailer for Warner Bros. documentary [March of the Penguins](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/penguins.mp4)
  * Cock and Drunk consultant on Stephen Woolley's film [Stoned](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/wp-content/kenkordastoned.mp4)

Each of these movies is about 5-7MB in size, and are in MP4 format.
