2007 is set to be an exciting year at Ning, with the launch (and continual development) of a product we have spent the last couple of months beavering away on, as well as a host of other improvements to the platform.

All this work requires a large amount of design, almost too much for our small team to handle at times.  That's why we're now on the look out for a talented designer/web-developer, who can join us full time in sunny [Palo Alto, California][1].

The ideal candidate for me would be somebody fairly similar to myself, that is someone who has a good understanding of both graphic design and standards based code, yet can also bring a few new qualities to the team.

You can see the [full job description on our site][2], but I'd like to highlight some of the requirements that I see as important:

  * Expert in programming with CSS, DHTML, JavaScript, HTML, and cross browser development.
  * Understanding of XML, DOM, and other W3C standards.
  * Strong understanding of browser based graphic design (e.g. browser palette, PNG, 8/24 vs. JPEG vs. GIF, etc.)
  * Ability to quickly iterate graphic designs/sketches using Photoshop (or similar)
  * Clean, systematic approach to UI development and implementation. Thinks like a programmer.
  * Comfortable working closely with developers in small team environment and business teams on tight deadlines.
  * Highly flexible and extremely efficient, don't mind multiple iterations on the way to the right answers.
  * Philosophy of iteration and continuous improvement over ivory-tower or complex-architecture projects.
