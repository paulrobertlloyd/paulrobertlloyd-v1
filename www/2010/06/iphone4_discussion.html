                    <p>I upgraded to iOS4 on my 3G and it became practically unusable it was so slow. So if you've not gone iOS4, don't. If you have, i recommend you downgrade to 3 again as it really is much faster. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you can go iPhone 4, do, you will seriously wonder how you ever managed with your 3G, they are worlds apart. After initial concern about signing a new long-term contract to get the thing, i'm very pleased i did. I've had no reception issues (well no worse than before!) and it's made using the device a pleasure again...</p>

                    <p>To be honest, other than providing Katie with a new phone (my current 3GS) I have little reason to upgrade. I really love my 3GS, and I'm increasingly put off by the reception problems widely reported with the 4.</p>

                    <p>Agree 100%. In the brief time that I've had a play with an iPhone 4 (having already updated my 3GS to iOS4), any thoughts of upgrading early were immediately eradicated. Once I got over the "oooh it's shiny..." phase, it was little more than what I was carrying in my pocket.</p>
                    <p>I'm a little envious of the 3G because it doesn't support Multi-tasking. In my opition, it's overrated. I've spent more time using it to close apps down completely than what it was designed to do. To me it's nothing more than a power-chowing pain which you seemingly can't disable with jail-breaking the phone.</p>

                    <p>Having gone from an iPhone 3G to the 4, I've gotta say how much of an improvement it is. The camera for one thing is incredible - I never used my 3G camera as the quality just wasn't high enough but the 4 has negated any need for me to buy a digital camera. The retina display is also very impressive, but I could have lived without it.</p>
                    <p>The most important thing for me though is the speed - I got so irritated by my 3G over the past few months as I could barely use some apps before it locked up and restarted. I haven't been able to induce any slow-down on the 4, it really is very impressive. Another big reason for me to upgrade was the battery life - where my 3G would die after 3/4 of a day under heavy usage, the 4 will last two days. </p>
                    <p>Personally, upgrading from the 3G to 4 was a must. I'd definitely have thought twice had I previously upgraded to the 3GS, but the level of improvement from the 3G is seriously impressive.</p>

                    <p>I agree. I have a 3GS, so I will get more out of iOS4 compared to the 3G, but although I would like to upgrade I realise—exactly like you said—my current phone is such a massive leap from my previous (and the fact I waited until the third generation) means I can let the new iteration pass me by. I am not interested in FaceTime, but the retina display and speed boost will be impressive when I finally upgrade. All the other features are software based - and I get.</p>
