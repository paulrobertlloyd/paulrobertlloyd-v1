                    <p><img class="left" src="/_gfx/2005/05/atmedia.gif" alt="@media2005 logo" />From the moment I entered through the doors of Kings College London, the venue in Waterloo where two days worth of web standards and accessibility goodness was to take place, I could tell that this was a well organised event. Receiving the conference program, notepad and pen all inside a very fetching orange laptop bag (that would later be useful for spotting all the web standards geeks as they headed to the after show parties), a well dressed venue, and excellent catering facilities, highlighted the level of detail that went into the conferences presentation.</p>
                    <p>After a quick coffee (and trying to spot anyone familiar looking), it was on to the keynote speech given by one <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Mr. Zeldman</a>. Titled <a href="http://www.happycog.com/clients/atmedia05/">&#8216;The Greatest Story Never Told&#8217;</a>, Jeffery gave an insight into the beginnings of the web standards movement and the reasons it was started. Needless to say I think we owe the founders (and todays members) a big thank-you for make our lives at least a little bit easier, and hopefully more so in the months and years to come.</p>
                    <div id="more">
                        <h2>The Presentations</h2>
                        <p>The range of presentations was roughly split 50/50: Web Standards (CSS/XHTML/Design/JavaScript) and Accessibility, but of all the presentations, those given by <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Douglas Bowman</a> were the most enjoyable. Whilst many of the speakers presentation slides were all of excellent quality (<a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">with S5 almost becoming a standard in itself</a>), Bowman&#8217;s Keynote powered presentations were absolutely beautiful to behold. Day Two&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/present/2005/atmedia/tactical.pdf">Tactical Manoeuvres</a> was perhaps my favourite, and with it I hope to have picked up several new techniques I can use within my sites.</p>
                        <p>On the accessibility side of things, watching <a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/">Robin Christopherson</a> navigate some very poorly designed sites using a screen reader (he is blind) really brought home why we should take more responsibility when designing websites. Also worthy of mention were <a href="http://www.joeclark.org/">Joe Clark</a>&#8217;s two very entertaining presentations that really highlighted some key problems and grey areas.</p>
                        <p>It would seem screen readers (JAWS being the most popular) not only behave differently between versions and even between point revisions, but the number of settings that a user can choose can really cause headaches when trying to create a site that is accessible to everybody regardless of browser device. This is definitely an area that I need to read more about, and it would be nice if we could get at a version of JAWS installed at work, making accessibility testing a key part of our production process.</p>
                        <h2>Sucking Eggs</h2>
                        <p>My only gripe with @media was that many of the presentations were well below the expectations of the audience. I&#8217;m not sure whether this conference was aimed at those who use web standards, or those who <em>should</em> use web standards, but the later was certainly in force, meaning there was a lot of &#8216;teaching to suck eggs&#8217;.</p>
                        <p>This became very clear on day one with <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/@media2005/">&#8216;Making the Jump to tableless design&#8217;</a>. Upon asking how many people were still designing layouts using tables, only one person put their hand up. The finale to the event was <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.malarkey.co.uk/Download.aspx?id=9">&#8216;Anatomy of a Mouse&#8217;</a>&#8212;which looked like it was going to be more of the same&#8212;but he changed tack and entertained and delighted us all in his inimitable style.</p>
                        <p>However, I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.vivabit.co.uk">Patrick</a>, who undoubtedly put on a great event is listening to how he can improve the event for next year. For my two pence worth, I would just like to see the conference step up a gear, more presentations on CSS organisation, more on topics such as <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">&#8216;Unobtrusive JavaScript&#8217;</a> provided by <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> at this years event, and more practical advice and solutions.</p>
                        <p>We all know what XHTML tags we should be using, and we all know how flexible a tool CSS is for designing. The thirst for real world solutions using these technologies was obvious, and I have no doubt @media will be even better in 2006 in this respect.</p>
                        <h2>Community Spirits</h2>
                        <p>Returning to the positive theme, the @media party on day one, and the @media wind down on day two were perhaps as important events as the conference itself. For many I guess meeting people and getting involved with the community on a face to face level is more of what these events are about.</p>
                        <p>For me, getting to see (and met a few of) &#8216;the stars&#8217; of the community was a worthwhile experience, as you realise they are essentially just the same as you&#8212;and more importantly very friendly and easy to chat to. Sadly I only found the courage to do so after a few beers, yet managed to restrain my glee when talking to Douglas Bowman and <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon Hicks</a>. It was quite funny talking to Jon, when I told him I was trying hard not to get over excited chatting to Doug Bowman that he was the same at SXSW earlier in the year&#8212;a good case in point.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the conference and the after show parties were a great opportunity to mingle with my peers, learn some new techniques, get a grip on accessibility and also meet people and make some new friends. The speakers were all of an excellent level, and for me learning of <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/06/11/the-passion-of-atmedia-2005/">their little wordpl@y</a> brought a little smile to my face and enhanced my experience more so. Here&#8217;s to @media 2006!</p>
